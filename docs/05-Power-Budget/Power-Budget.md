title: Power Budget (Roshan Roy Geoffrey Joe)
---

## Overview

This page is a work in progress of the final power budget. Each of the power constraints and specifcities are attached in the pdf/excel, but also summarized below:

* All Major Components: each device with voltage range, qty, absolute max current, and estimated operating current
* +5 V Rail: loads (MCU, sensor, LM358, red LED), subtotal, +25% margin, and a 5 V/500 mA regulator block with remaining capacity
* +3.3 V Rail: placeholder sheet (in case we later move the sensor/MCU to 3.3 V)
* External Power Source: a generic 9 V/1 A wall supply driving the 5 V regulator, with remaining headroom

## Conclusions

Updated after the Design Review

## Resouces

The power budget as a PDF download is available [*here*](PowerBudgetRoshan.pdf), and a Microsoft Excel Sheet [*here*](PowerBudgetRoshan.xlsx).
