This idea was developed to provide an easier way to control your lights, especially for older people, while maintaining the comfort of your house. The clap light is also equipped with manual switches for power and a setting to dim the lights to your preference.</p> <p>The Sensor Front-End Board is responsible for translating digital control signals from the Master Controller into physical lamp actuation, while also integrating a light sensor to monitor ambient light conditions. This subsystem receives a lamp toggle command from the hub through an 8-pin connector, uses an LM358 non-inverting op amp to amplify the signal from a TEMT6000 light sensor, and provides real-time feedback via an LED output.</p> <p>Attached here is the link to our team report.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My contribution focuses on designing and implementing the Sensor Front-End subsystem, which includes:</p> <pre><code>* Selecting and integrating a TEMT6000 light sensor and an LM358 non-inverting op amp circuit to provide an amplified analog signal to the microcontroller\u2019s ADC.\n\n* Configuring PWM and DAC outputs on the PIC18F57Q43 to control a red LED for visual feedback and a MOSFET or relay driver to actuate the lamp.\n\n* Implementing signal mapping between the hub and my board, including UART RX and a digital input line for lamp toggle control.\n\n* Ensuring clean and labeled power distribution (+5 V regulated) and proper grounding shared with the team boards.\n</code></pre> <p>This subsystem plays a key role in turning control signals into real-world actuation, ensuring reliable lamp operation under different environmental conditions.</p> <p>To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the \"BOM\" section of the datasheet.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individal Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Below is the individual block diagram for the Sensor Front End of the overall board.
