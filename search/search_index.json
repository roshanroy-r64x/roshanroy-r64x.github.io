Price and availability are also solid.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#op-amp-module","title":"Op-Amp Module","text":"Solution Pros Cons  TI LM358$0.50/eachLink to product * Dual amp; single-supply 5 V operation* Tolerant of inputs near ground * Not rail-to-rail in/out* Input bias &amp; offset higher than modern CMOS parts  MCP6002-E/P  $0.60/each  Link to product * Rail-to-rail I/O * Great at 5 V or 3.3 V  * Good for sensor buffering * Lower GBW (1 MHz) may limit high-speed filtering  TLV2372IDR$1.45/eachLink to product * Rail-to-rail* 3 MHz GBW; more headroom* low power per channel * Higher cost * SOIC/T&amp;R variants may require SMD rework skills <p>Choice: MCP6002</p> <p>Rationale: For an ambient-light signal into the PIC\u2019s ADC, rail-to-rail I/O, low power, and clean operation at 5 V are more valuable than bandwidth. MCP6002 gives simpler headroom management than LM358 with minimal cost increase.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#light-sensor-module","title":"Light Sensor Module","text":"Solution Pros Cons  TEMT6000X01$0.90/eachLink to product * Simple analog output* Fast response and tiny footprint * Works directly with op-amp/ADC * Output is non-linear vs. lux* Requires biasing and calibration * Sensitive to angle/spectrum  BH1750FVI  $4.00/each  Link to product * Reports lux directly via I\u00b2C * Minimal analog design * Requires I\u00b2C + library * Fixed spectrum/transfer function * Module size &gt; bare sensor  Adafruit VEML7700 Lux Sensor - I2C Light Sensor - STEMMA QT / Qwiic$5.00/eachLink to product * Wide 0\u2013120 klux, 16-bit * adjustable gain/integration * 3.3/5 V friendly and accurate lux output * I\u00b2C interface required <p>Choice: TEMT6000</p> <p>Rationale: Since there is already an ADC channel, TEMT6000 keeps BOM cost and firmware complexity low while providing fast analog response. If calibrated, it\u2019s sufficient for relative brightness feedback to the LED driver.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
